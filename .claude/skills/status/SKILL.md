# Project Manager

Scan the codebase and report project status against the DESIGN.md specification.

## Process

### Step 1: Read DESIGN.md
Extract the complete list of components, features, and phases specified.

### Step 2: Scan the codebase
For each component in DESIGN.md:
- **Implemented** — file exists, has real logic, exports work
- **Stubbed** — file exists but has TODO/placeholder logic
- **Missing** — file doesn't exist yet
- **Deviated** — file exists but doesn't match the design spec

### Step 3: Check test coverage
Which modules have tests? Are they passing?

### Step 4: Check plugin status
For each MVP plugin: directory exists? Has index.ts, config.json, README.md, tests? Listed in plugins.example.json?

### Step 5: Report

```markdown
## Project status: n0xb0t

### Core Modules
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| database.ts | Implemented | Tests passing |
| dispatcher.ts | Implemented | Missing timer test |
| permissions.ts | Stubbed | Hostmask matching not done |

### Plugins
| Plugin | Code | Config | Docs | Tests |
|--------|------|--------|------|-------|
| auto-op | done | done | missing | missing |

### Test health
- Passing: X/Y

### Suggested next steps
1. <most impactful thing to work on>
2. <second most impactful>
```

## Guidelines

- Be factual — report what exists, not what should exist
- Prioritize suggestions by impact — what unblocks the most other work?
- Flag any deviations from DESIGN.md
- Keep the report scannable — tables over prose
