# Builder

Execute an implementation plan produced by `/plan`, building features step by step.

## Process

### Step 1: Read the plan

Read the plan markdown completely. Identify:
- The phases and their order
- Dependencies between phases
- Config or database changes needed
- Files that will be created or modified

### Step 2: Read project context

Before writing any code:
1. Read `DESIGN.md` for architectural patterns
2. Read existing code in the areas being modified to understand patterns in use
3. Read existing tests to follow testing conventions
4. Check `package.json` for available dependencies

### Step 3: Execute phase by phase

For each phase in the plan:

1. **Announce** what you're building in this phase
2. **Implement** each checklist item, writing clean code that follows project conventions
3. **Verify** using the plan's verification step — run tests, check behavior
4. **Report** completion of the phase and any issues encountered
5. **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding to the next phase (unless user has said to go ahead)

### Step 4: Post-implementation

After all phases are complete:
1. Run the full test suite
2. Update any documentation affected by the changes
3. Check the plan's checklist — mark items as done
4. Summarize what was built and any deviations from the plan

## Code conventions

**Module style:**
```typescript
// ESM imports at top
import { EventDispatcher } from './dispatcher.js';

/**
 * Brief description.
 * @param channel - Channel name
 */
export async function doThing(channel: string): Promise<void> { }
```

**Plugin structure:**
```typescript
export const name = 'plugin-name';
export const version = '1.0.0';
export const description = 'What it does';

export function init(api: PluginAPI) {
  api.bind('pub', '-', '!command', async (ctx) => {
    ctx.reply('response');
  });
  api.log('Plugin loaded');
}

export function teardown() {
  // Cleanup (binds are auto-removed by the loader)
}
```

**Logging:** `console.log(\`[plugin:\${pluginId}] Loaded successfully\`);`

## Guidelines

- Never deviate from DESIGN.md patterns without flagging it to the user
- If a plan step is ambiguous, ask before guessing
- Write tests alongside code, not after
- Keep plugins self-contained — no cross-plugin imports
- Respect the bind type semantics (stackable vs non-stackable)
- Always handle async errors — an unhandled rejection in a plugin should not crash the bot
